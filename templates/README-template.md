## Course Description

Storing, managing, and processing datasets are foundational processes in data
science. This course introduces the fundamental knowledge and skills of data
engineering that are required to be effective as a data scientist. This course
focuses on the basics of data pipelines, data pipeline flows and associated
business use cases, and how organizations derive value from data and data
engineering.  As these fundamentals of data engineering are introduced,
learners will interact with data and data processes at various stages in the
pipeline, understand key data engineering tools and platforms, and use and
connect critical technologies through which one can construct storage and
processing architectures that underpin data science applications.

## Course Format

The course is organized as an online inverted classroom. During each week, students first
work through a set of asynchronous materials, including video lectures, readings, and other
activities. Once a week, students meet for a 90-minute live session, in which they connect with
an instructor and other students in an online classroom. A functioning webcam and an audio
headset are required to participate in the live sessions. Students must complete all assigned
asynchronous material before the scheduled live session begins.

## Course Objectives

### Tools and Technologies

Students will:

- Build practical experience building data pipelines.
- Build practical experience cleaning, anonymizing, and plumbing data.
- Learn tooling for queries and query management (e.g., BigQuery, SQL).
- Learn tooling for analytics (jupyter, python, py-based-libs).
- Get exposure to advanced tooling for analytics (spark, kafka, etc).
- Learn how to leverage revision control.
- Learn how to use docker to assemble common tools for analysis.
- Build practical experience leveraging cloud-based resources for data analytics.
- Build practical experience consuming data and services from APIs.
- Get exposure to events and event-log based analytics.

### Concepts

Students will:

- Learn to keep their analysis grounded in busines relevence.
- Get exposure to some basic distributed storage and compute concepts.
- Get exposure to some basic RDBMS concepts.
- Get exposre to RDB -vs- NoSQL tooling and approaches.
- Get exposure to some basic data warehousing concepts.
- Learn the basics of virtualization and containerization.
- Understand how analysis changes wrt scale / complexity of data.
- Learn about data partitioning.
- Learn about latency in data analysis.
- Get exposure to ETL -vs- NoETL.
- Learn the basic concepts of web-based applications.
- Understand how basic data privacy, security, and chain-of-custody works.


## Evaluation & Grading

The 12 assignments will cumulatively build into 3 projects: the Query Project, the Tracking User Activity Project and the Understanding User Behavior Project. Each assignment will be a part of one of these projects. Each assignment will be a hands-on lab that is completed both individually and revisited during the synchronous weekly group sessions. Ten of the twelve assignments will be graded.

Your final grade will be as follows:

- 10% for each of the 10 graded assignments

These assignments are the core of this course. Your work on them is one of the best ways for you to learn. To allow you to get the most out of each assignment, we iterate through each of them. For example, for Assignment 1: 1) you'll work in groups and hear from us about the content of the assignment in Week 1, then 2) you'll work on it independently and/or in groups during the week, coming to Week 2's synchronous session with an attempt at the assignment and any questions you have, next 3) we will review it and address questions during Week 2's synchronous session, and finally, 4) the final version of the assignment will be due the next day. 

## Readings
Most readings are available through a subscription to https://www.safaribooksonline.com/. Other readings are blogposts and links.


## Prerequisites

- Previous experience with Python.
- Basic knowledge of Unix/Linux commands and tools as well as concepts such as processes, file systems.
- In addition we'll use Docker, Git, and SQL as well as other tools.
- If you feel like you're not where you'd like to be with these technologies/tools, here are some resources to get up to speed. There are options, pick which one best suits your needs.

## Course Outline
The course consists of 4 sections: A 3-week Introduction that covers the basics
of storage and retrieval concepts and tools; a 5-week Basics section that
provides a deeper exploration of working with data and data pipelines; a 4-week
section that focuses on Streaming Data; and a concluding section, Putting it
All Together, that integrates concepts and skills from the entire course into a
cohesive model of the data pipeline.

In addition to the sequenced material covered, the course also includes
Tutorial materials that focus on technical skills associated with data
engineering technologies, tools, and platforms. These tutorials also provide a
practical foundation for the discussions and activities that will take place in
the live classroom for specific weeks in the term.
